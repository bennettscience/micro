title: Not Sure

I'm not entirely sure what to do with this space. It's been a couple of weeks since I've written. I moved my main blog back to 
WordPress because Jekyll wasn't helping my writing habit. 

I've started some graduate classes and those are taking up the majority of my free time with reading and discussion forum posts (ugh).

A micro site is nice. I need to find a more purposeful use for it. No database is cool, but I have to be more intentional about posting.

Maybe I can write up a quick web extension to create text files through the GitHub API. Maybe that would help. Not really sure where this will go.
