This last year has brought some significant growth to my faith. We joined a new church and it's become a much more stark reality that I am helplessly afflicted by sin, unable to defeat it under my own power, and without hope.

Except. God has offered us mercy through His son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

1 Peter 1:3-4 tells us that we are "born again...to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for [me]..." Beyond that, in verses 10-12, Peter tells us that the prophets were led by the Spirit of Jesus himself about when the grace would be offered. Even more incredible, v 14:

"It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves <i>but you,</i> in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look."

God revealed his plan to the prophets, who taught us how to look for Jesus.

Jesus came as a man and as God and lived with us, experiencing <i>everything</i> we experience during our lives so he can become the perfect advocate for us in heaven (Heb 4:14-16). He lived in obedience to God and was crucified by men. God exalted Jesus and gave him dominion over everything (Phil 2:9) and will bring glory to God when his name is confessed by all people.

The God of the universe has woven history to reveal himself to his people, if only our hearts would be soft when we hear His voice (Heb 3:7) so as not to be forsaken at the day of judgement.

God, make my heart soft.
