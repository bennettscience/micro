My role next year involves staff coaching in a more formal context. I've done some this year, but it's mainly been sitting in on department or small group meetings and helping define goals and outcomes for the group. I'm trying to formalize that process for next year.

Part of the challenge in setting up this system is that I need to ask people for their instructional goals to build context. Every year, teachers define goals (usually based on assessments, test scores, etc) and they're never looked at. I want to make sure these are instructional practices - things they want to <i>improve</i> as teachers. But doing it in a document looks like the same old story with a new name.

Changing culture is difficult. I want to make it more innovative, but there is also a part of me that says efficiency and clarity is more important than innovation at times. This may be one of those times.
