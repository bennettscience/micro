I just finished listening to <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/the-habitat" target="blank">The Habitat</a>, a podcast about a Mars simulation run in Hawaii in 2016. Six volunteers were shut into a simulated habitat which could be on the surface of Mars one day. The goal of the research was to see how people, put together in a challenging living environment, would work together as a team.

The idea is compelling and the podcast had some bright spots. Coming from a scientific perspective, I struggled to buy into the idea of this simulating a group of people on Mars for several reasons.

One, the six volunteers didn't have much pre-training time. They were chosen and briefed and didn't really meet one another until they reached Hawaii. NASA is famous for <i>intense</i> preplanning and training with crews defined years in advance. A true team selected for a Mars mission would have a huge amount of time to build relationships and trust in one another. Much of the drama highlighted in the podcast revolved around the fact that these people were <i>just</i> getting to know one another when the door closed behind them.

Two, there didn't seem to be much to do on the mission. A lot of the podcast has people talking about how boring it all is, how they have to find ways to fill time on their own. Again, if this is supposed to be a Mars simulation, why isn't there more task-based work? Nothing needing specialized training, of course, but it's hard to imagine NASA sending astronauts to a planet to just sit.

Admittedly, these are more gripes about the show than the mission itself. We didn't have any hint of work or tasks for the crew until episode six (out of seven in the series). I don't feel like there was any real development of the individuals in the habitat and what was discussed felt superficial and highlighted quirks rather than providing insight into who they were and why they signed up to live in a glorified army tent for a year.

Interestingly, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/29/491794937/mars-mission-crew-emerges-from-yearlong-simulation-in-hawaii" target="blank">a participant called out that very criticism of the experiment</a>:

<blockquote>"Bring something to work on. Something meaningful to work on," Heinicke said in a video posted to Twitter on Sunday by the University of Hawaii, which is running the NASA-funded research project. "One of your biggest enemies is boredom. The other big enemies, of course, are the rest of the crew," she said, laughing.</blockquote>

The premise is curious and the research is important. I'm disappointed in the execution of the show now that I've hit the end. It felt thin...like it lacked resolution because there wasn't anything to hold on to over the run of the show.
